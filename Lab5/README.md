One R-script was created, called run_analysis.R, which
performs the following actions.
1. Combines training and test sets to create a single data set.
2. Extracts only average and standard measurements
mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names for the name
activities in the data set.
4. Assigns descriptive names to variables in the data set accordingly.
5. From the data set from step 4, create a second independent tidy dataset with an average value for each variable for each activity and each subject.
